Assign the shape of vector to vector_shape.
Assign the shape of matrix to matrix_shape.
Display both vector_shape and matrix_shape using the print() function.

###########

vector = np.array([10, 20, 30])
matrix = np.array([[5, 10, 15], [20, 25, 30], [35, 40, 45]])
vector_shape = vector.shape
print(vector_shape)
matrix_shape = matrix.shape
print(matrix_shape)
